Team 20 Knowledge Base
===
Welcome to the Team 20 Programming Knowledge Base! This houses various programming resources, ranging from explaining robot code, to advanced tricks and examples to use in robot code. It is meant to be a reference of sorts for programming related tasks like programming LEDs, keyboard shortcuts, or software downloads.

Project Scope
===
Here are some guidelines on what should and shouldn't be in the knowledge base. You don't have to follow them exactly, but use them to help determine if some bit of knowledge is novel enough to be included in the knowledge base.

What this project includes
---
- Non-obvious and advanced code tricks, e.g, timers in commands
- Explanations on how things work or how to do something, e.g., explaining subsystems and commands, or programming LEDs
- Code examples/snippets with explanations
- Guides for setting up and configuring tools
- Other useful information that isn't obvious

If it's non-obvious and leans towards the obscure side of things, stick it here with documentation/an explanation of what it is.

What this project doesn't include
---
- "Basic" knowledge, e.g., if statements
- A Java guide
- Random code snippets
- Documentation for year-specific code. This is for general knowledge, year-specific code should have inline documentation
