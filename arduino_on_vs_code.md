# Programming Arduinos with VS Code

If you want to program Arduinos, here are the steps to get started.

1. Install the [Arduino VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-arduino)
2. Open up an Arduino sketch, and select a board(as of 2023, it's an Arduino Nano, but double check.)  
   You can now edit the code with all the features like autocomplete, formatting, etc.
3. If you haven't already, use a cable to connect to the Arduino.
4. Select the serial port.
5. Open the Command Palette and search for `Upload`. It doesn't matter if you pick the `Arduino` one or the `Arduino CLI` one, as long as it has `Arduino` in the name.
